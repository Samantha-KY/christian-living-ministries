            Since 1992 New Creation Ministries has provided<br />
            training to Rwandans who are doing ministry in their<br />
            churches, workplaces and homes. Our aim isn't just to<br />
            provide our students with knowledge or skills. We want<br />
            them to be transformed by what they're learning - to<br />
            become true disciples of Jesus.

            Approximately 80% of Rwandans live in rural areas,<br />
            without access to theological training in their own<br />
            language. The Pastoral Training School exists to meet<br />
            that need. Over the course of three years, church<br />
            leaders take courses in Biblical theology and gain skills<br />
            that they can immediately apply in their ministry<br />
            contexts. We also provide personalized mentoring and<br />
            discipleship by visiting students in their homes and<br />
            observing them in their ministries.

            As Rwanda develops, there is a growing desire and<br />
            need for quality higher education taught from a<br />
            Christian perspective. We are working to launch the<br />
            Christian Leadership Institute of Rwanda (CLIR) as an<br />
            accredited university with bachelor and masters level<br />
            programs. We have an amazing opportunity to impact<br />
            Rwandan society by discipling its future theologians,<br />
            educators, business leaders and community developers.

            Rwanda continues to be a largely agrarian society with<br />
            many people growing all of their own food. As the<br />
            population of Rwanda increases, land is becoming<br />
            scarce, food costs are rising, and food shortages are<br />
            common. Many Rwandans eat only one meal a day.<br />
            The Agricultural Demonstration program seeks to<br />
            introduce Rwandans to new ways of growing food and<br />
            stewarding their land. By connecting Biblical values<br />
            with improved farming techniques, we seek to address<br />
            the spiritual and practical needs of our students, their<br />
            families, and their communities.
